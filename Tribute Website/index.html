                    <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
                    <p><span>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span> was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman
                        who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family
                        in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
                        decades
                        as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                        Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
                        India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be
                        known
                        as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                        vehicle
                        technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                        Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
